EM-APEX tools written in MATLAB and python.

Requires the MATLAB toolkit gibbs seawater (gsw) for TEOS-10.

Requires m_map toolbox for some of the plotting.

Requires scipy, numpy and matplotlib.

Requires gsw python package. 

Experiments with MCMC fitting requires pymc.

Uses Smith and Sandwell bathymetry for some of the plotting.

Very much a work in progress.
