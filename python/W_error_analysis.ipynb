      "James: \"There will likely be a peak around $N$ (which will be broad because of the range of stratification values in the profile but probably is real internal wave signal). If you see a white spectrum of level $P$ at higher frequencies up to the Nyquist ($f_{Ny}$), the RMS $W_w$ noise estimate is $\\sqrt{P f_{Ny}}$.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alberto: \"... look at vertical wavenumber spectra of $W_w$ and compare them with the Garrett-Munk model of the internal wave field. We should see that above some characteristic high wavenumber noise dominates our signal, and estimate the $W_w$ magnitude typically associated with wavenumbers  higher than that from the integrated $W_w$ variance in that part of the spectrum.\"\n",
